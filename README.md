# Deep-Learning-using-PyTorch
I have used these to learn Deep Learning using PyTorch. 
This project includes implementation of Feed Forward Neural Network, 
Image Classification with CNN, Data Augmentation, Regularization, ResNet, and Transfer Learning (using ResNet34). 
I didn't focus on the accuracy during doing this as I used Google CoLab to implement the algorithms 
and the GPU memory is limited there. 

Dataset used: MNIST, Cifer10, and Oxford-IIIT-Pet
